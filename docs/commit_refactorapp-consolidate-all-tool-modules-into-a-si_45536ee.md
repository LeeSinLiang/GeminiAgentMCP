### **Refactoring: Consolidation of MCP Tools into a Single Application File**

This update introduces a significant refactoring to simplify the project structure. All Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, previously organized in a modular `src/tools/` directory, have been consolidated into a single `src/app.py` file. This change streamlines the codebase, simplifies the application's entry point, and removes the direct dependency on `uvicorn`.

---

### **Detailed Changes**

#### 1. **Code Consolidation and New Entry Point**
- **New File:** `src/app.py` has been created. It now contains the definitions for all MCP tools, including:
  - `call_gemini`
  - `create_github_issue` & `create_github_pr`
  - `summarize_docs` & `generate_docstrings`
  - `analyze_dependencies`
  - `lint_code` & `generate_unit_tests`
- This file also serves as the new executable entry point for the server, using `mcp.run()` to start the service.

#### 2. **File Deletions and Relocations**
- **Deleted:** The previous main application file, `src/main.py`, has been removed.
- **Deleted:** The entire `src/tools/` directory and all its modules (`code.py`, `dependencies.py`, `docs.py`, `gemini.py`, `github.py`) have been deleted as their contents are now in `src/app.py`.
- **Moved:** The utility module has been relocated from `src/tools/utils.py` to `src/utils.py`.

#### 3. **Dependency Management**
- **Removed:** The `uvicorn` package has been removed from `requirements.txt`. The `fastmcp` library now manages the server lifecycle directly.

#### 4. **API Modification**
- The `call_gemini` tool's signature has been updated for clarity. The `context` parameter has been renamed to `system_instruction`.

---

### **Impact**

- **Simplified Codebase:** The project structure is now flatter and easier to navigate, with all core tool logic centralized in one location.
- **Simplified Execution:** The server is now started with a standard Python command, abstracting away the underlying web server implementation.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Centralizing tool definitions can make them easier to manage and discover.

---

### **Usage**

To run the MCP server, execute the new application file directly from your terminal:

```bash
# Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN is set if using GitHub tools
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"

# Run the server
python src/app.py
```

The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default.

**Example: Updated `call_gemini` Tool Usage**

The `call_gemini` tool now uses the `system_instruction` parameter.

*   **Old Usage:**
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "call_gemini",
      "parameters": {
        "prompt": "Explain the concept of recursion.",
        "context": "You are a helpful programming assistant."
      }
    }
    ```

*   **New Usage:**
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "call_gemini",
      "parameters": {
        "prompt": "Explain the concept of recursion.",
        "system_instruction": "You are a helpful programming assistant."
      }
    }
    ```

---

### **Breaking Changes**

1.  **Server Startup Command:** The previous method of starting the server (e.g., `uvicorn src.main:app`) is no longer valid. The application must be run via `python src/app.py`.
2.  **`call_gemini` Tool API:** Any client code or automation that calls the `call_gemini` tool must be updated to use the `system_instruction` parameter instead of `context`.
3.  **Internal Imports:** The internal module paths have changed. Any custom extensions that imported from `src.tools.*` will be broken.

---

### **Migration Notes**

- **Update Startup Scripts:** Modify any deployment scripts, Dockerfiles, or process managers (like `systemd`) to use the new startup command: `python src/app.py`.
- **Update Client Integrations:** Review and update any applications or scripts that interact with the `call_gemini` tool to align with the new parameter name.
- **Update Environment:** It is safe to remove `uvicorn` from your environment if it was installed as a direct dependency. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to sync your dependencies.
