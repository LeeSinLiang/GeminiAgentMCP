## Project Documentation: Gemini Agent MCP Server

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the key architectural changes, feature enhancements, and refactoring efforts for the Gemini Agent MCP Server.

### 1. Summary

The Gemini Agent MCP Server is a Python-based service that exposes a suite of developer tools via a JSON-RPC 2.0 API, enabling AI agents to perform tasks like code generation, linting, and GitHub operations.

The project has undergone several significant evolutions:
*   **Initial Implementation:** A Flask-based server providing core developer tools.
*   **Architectural Migration:** A shift from the synchronous Flask framework to the high-performance, asynchronous **FastMCP** framework.
*   **API Enhancement:** A major refactor to use Pydantic models for strongly-typed API responses.
*   **Code Consolidation:** A structural simplification, merging all tool modules into a single application file.

### 2. Key Changes and Evolution

#### a. Initial Implementation (Commit b19a169)

The project was created as a Flask-based server with a set of modular tools designed for AI agent interaction.

*   **Core Functionality:** Provided a JSON-RPC endpoint (`/jsonrpc`) and an MCP manifest (`/mcp`).
*   **Initial Toolset:** Included tools for Gemini model interaction, GitHub issue/PR creation, code linting (`pylint`, `eslint`), test generation, and dependency analysis.
*   **Security:** Implemented a `is_safe_path` utility to prevent directory traversal attacks.

#### b. Architectural Migration to FastMCP (Commit c74c5d0)

The web service layer was migrated from Flask (WSGI) to the asynchronous FastMCP framework to improve performance and scalability.

*   **Dependencies:** `Flask` and `flask-jsonrpc` were replaced with `fastmcp` and `uvicorn`.
*   **Impact:** This was a **major breaking change**, moving the application to a fully asynchronous (ASGI) architecture. All Flask-specific code became obsolete.
*   **Usage Change:** The server is now started with an ASGI server.
    ```bash
    # Previous method of running with Flask is no longer valid.
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

#### c. Enhanced Tool Definitions with Pydantic (Commit 2431280)

To improve type safety and API clarity, all tool outputs were refactored to use Pydantic models instead of generic dictionaries.

*   **API Outputs:** Tools now return Pydantic `BaseModel` instances (e.g., `GitHubPrResponse`, `LintingReport`).
*   **Type Hinting:** Function parameters were enhanced with `typing.Annotated` for better self-documentation.
*   **Breaking Change:** The return type of every tool has changed. Client code must be updated to access data via model attributes instead of dictionary keys.
*   **Migration:**
    *   **Before:** `pr_url = result['pr_url']`
    *   **After:** `pr_url = result.pr_url`

#### d. Code Consolidation and API Refinements (Commits 45536ee, daadf1b)

The project structure was simplified by consolidating all tool modules from the `src/tools/` directory into a single `src/app.py` file.

*   **Structure:** The `src/tools/` directory was removed. `src/app.py` is now the single source for all tool logic and the application entry point.
*   **Usage Change:** The server startup command was simplified.
    ```bash
    python src/app.py
    ```
*   **Breaking Changes:**
    1.  **`call_gemini` API:** The `context` parameter was renamed to `system_instruction`. Clients calling this tool must update the parameter name.
    2.  **Health Check Endpoint:** The `greeting://{name}` endpoint was removed and replaced with a `hello://{name}` health check endpoint. The response format also changed from `"Hello, {name}!"` to `"Server OK. Hello, {name}!"`.

### 3. Current Usage

**1. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Configure Environment:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

**3. Run the Server:**
```bash
python src/app.py
```

The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default.
