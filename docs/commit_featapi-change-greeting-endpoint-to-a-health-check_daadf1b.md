## API Refactoring, Code Quality, and Configuration Updates

This update introduces a breaking change by refactoring a key API endpoint for clarity and purpose. It also includes significant improvements to code quality through enhanced documentation, safer logging, and updated project configuration.

### Summary

The primary change in this release is the renaming and repurposing of the `greeting://` endpoint to `hello://`, which now functions as a health check. Additionally, all Pydantic models have been documented with docstrings, logging for the Gemini tool has been improved to be more concise, and the project's `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude common Python artifacts and documentation folders.

### Changes

#### 1. API Endpoint Refactoring (Breaking Change)

The existing `greeting` endpoint has been completely refactored to serve as a health check.

*   **Endpoint URI:** Changed from `greeting://{name}` to `hello://{name}`.
*   **Functionality:** The endpoint's purpose is now to confirm server health while providing a greeting.
*   **Response Payload:** The response format has changed from `"Hello, {name}!"` to `"Server OK. Hello, {name}!"`.

#### 2. Code Quality & Documentation

*   **Pydantic Model Docstrings:** All Pydantic models (`GeminiResponse`, `GitHubIssueResponse`, etc.) now include descriptive docstrings. This improves code readability and enhances auto-generated API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
*   **Improved Logging:** The `call_gemini_impl` function now truncates long prompts in log messages to the first 50 characters. This prevents excessively large log entries and improves log readability.

#### 3. Project Configuration

*   **`.gitignore` Updates:** The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude the following:
    *   `__pycache__/`: Python bytecode cache directories.
    *   `docs/`: Generated documentation folders.
    *   `.venv/`: Python virtual environment directories.

### Impact

*   **Client Integration:** Any client or service currently using the `greeting://` endpoint will break and must be updated to use the new `hello://` endpoint and handle the new response format.
*   **Developer Experience:** The addition of docstrings and improved logging significantly enhances code maintainability and makes debugging easier.
*   **Repository Cleanliness:** The `.gitignore` updates ensure that local development artifacts are not accidentally committed to the repository.

### Usage

To check the server's health and receive a greeting, make a request to the new `hello://` endpoint.

**Example Request:**
```
GET /hello/World
```

**Example Response:**
```json
"Server OK. Hello, World!"
```

### Breaking Changes

**Endpoint Removed and Replaced**

The `greeting://{name}` endpoint has been **removed**. It is replaced by the `hello://{name}` endpoint, which has a different purpose and response schema.

*   **Old Endpoint:** `GET greeting://{name}` -> `"Hello, {name}!"`
*   **New Endpoint:** `GET hello://{name}` -> `"Server OK. Hello, {name}!"`

Direct calls to the old endpoint will result in a "Not Found" error.

### Migration Notes

To adapt to this change, developers must update any client code that interacts with the old greeting service.

1.  **Update the URI:** Change all instances of `greeting://` to `hello://`.
2.  **Update Response Handling:** Adjust any logic that parses the response to account for the new `"Server OK. "` prefix in the string.

**Before:**
```python
# Old client code
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/greeting/Alice")
# response.text -> "Hello, Alice!"
```

**After:**
```python
# New client code
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/hello/Alice")
# response.text -> "Server OK. Hello, Alice!"
```
