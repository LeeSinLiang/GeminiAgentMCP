### **Refactor: Overhaul and Restructure Project README**

#### **1. Summary**

This update completely rewrites the `README.md` to adopt a more professional and standardized open-source project format. The new documentation improves clarity by introducing dedicated sections for features, technologies, and development conventions. It streamlines the setup process and provides a clearer, high-level overview of the project's capabilities, moving away from a detailed, procedural guide.

#### **2. Changes**

*   **Structural Overhaul:** The previous "Setup" and "Usage" sections have been replaced with a more conventional structure, including:
    *   `Key Technologies`: Lists core technologies like Python and FastMCP.
    *   `Features`: A new, comprehensive list of all available server tools (e.g., `call_gemini`, `lint_code`, `create_github_pr`) and their descriptions.
    *   `Getting Started`: A simplified section for prerequisites and installation.
    *   `Development`: A new section detailing project conventions like linting.
    *   `License`: A standard license section.

*   **Content Simplification:**
    *   Removed detailed setup instructions for external dependencies like `eslint` and environment variables (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `MCP_PORT`).
    *   Removed the explicit JSON-RPC `curl` example and the "Security" section explaining file path validation.

*   **Configuration & Command Updates:**
    *   The server startup script has been renamed from `src/main.py` to `src/app.py`.
    *   The default server port has been changed from `5001` to `8000`.

#### **3. Impact**

*   **Improved Developer Experience:** The new structure makes it significantly easier for developers to quickly understand the project's purpose, full feature set, and how to get it running.
*   **Enhanced Clarity:** The "Features" section provides excellent discoverability for the server's capabilities, which was previously absent.
*   **Standardization:** The README now aligns with common practices for open-source software documentation, making it more familiar to new contributors.

#### **4. Usage**

The primary change affecting usage is the command to run the server.

**New Command:**
```bash
python src/app.py
```
The server will now start on `0.0.0.0:8000` by default.

#### **5. Breaking Changes**

1.  **Startup Command:** The entry point for running the application has changed. Scripts or processes using `python src/main.py` will fail.
2.  **Default Port:** The server's default port has been changed from `5001` to `8000`. Any clients, scripts, or firewall rules configured for the old port will no longer connect without updates.

#### **6. Migration Notes**

*   **Update Startup Scripts:** Change any execution commands from `python src/main.py` to `python src/app.py`.
*   **Update Port Configuration:** Adjust any client configurations, reverse proxies, or environment variables to target the new default port `8000`.
